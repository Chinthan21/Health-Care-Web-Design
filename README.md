# Health-Care-Web-Design
Developed and implemented Health Care web page using Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript and HTML

I Develop and Implement Habiffy Assignment. 
In summary, the web application allows users to submit new account details, redirects them to the next page, displays a badge upon clicking the latest heading, and enables redirection to the previous page by clicking the logo at the top of the page. 
The project utilizes a combination of VSCode, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5 to create a user-friendly and interactive experience for the users.

Sometimes, if the redirection doesn't occur, you may need to click on the search bar and press the enter button on your system.
